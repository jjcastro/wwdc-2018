 # Let's take a trip
 
 
 Hi, I'm Juan! ðŸ¤“
 
 I'm 20 years old and I'm an aspiring developer and designer from [BogotÃ¡](glossary://bogota).
 
 Lately I've been getting **really** into 3D graphics, specifically [WebGL](glossary://webgl). Today I'm excited to take you on a trip through [ARKit](glossary://arkit) and its capabilities, as seen through the lens of a low-level 3D graphics enthusiast.
 
 Along the way, we'll be writing in 3D, playing some Colombian games, and even creating our very own [jardincito](glossary://jardincito). But first, *let's start with the basics*.

 ## Scene understanding & plane detection
 
 One of the main capabilities of Augmented Reality with [ARKit](glossary://arkit) is **scene understanding**. As it begins to understand your physical environment, your iPad is currently evaluating the scene over multiple frames to **detect surfaces** on which you can place 3D objects on (plane detection).
 
  * callout(Look out):
 The detected surfaces will be displayed covered with a dotted grid. Just like the official WWDC18 artwork!
 
 *In this example*, our goal is to display a nice WWDC 2018 "name tag" onto this surface. Tap on the detected surfaces to create a 3D name tag.
 
 Using the `setWWDCAttendee(name:_, location:_)` function, you can set the name and location for our would-be WWDC 2018 attendee. I took the liberty of filling it out with someone who would make a great candidate!
