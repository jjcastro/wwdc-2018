 **Goal:** Make a house out of building blocks!
 
 ## Hit testing
 
 Another great utility [ARKit](glossary://arkit) provides is hit testing. Hit testing helps in taking our screen‚Äôs 2D coordinates turning them into real world 3D coordinates, by intersecting features in the scene. üó∫
 
 This allows us to place objects directly onto the scene by way of user interaction (i.e. tapping on the screen) because each screen location can correspond to a real world location.
 
 - Note:
 There‚Äôs many ways in which we can do hit testing. In this example, were using `.existingPlaneUsingExtent`, meaning we‚Äôre intersecting the detected surfaces on the scene.

 In this chapter, we‚Äôll be playing a building block game in AR, taking advantage of the wonders of hit testing. The blocks are even made from Apple‚Äôs *signature white glossy plastic*!
 
 **Try this:**
 
 Change the width and height of your block using `changeSize`. Then try to build the biggest possible structure using these blocks!
