 ### Tejo AR
 
 Tejo is the national sport of Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´.
 
 While there is not one widely accepted theory on the origins of tejo, it's widely accepted that the sport has origins in native aboriginals from the center of Colombia, where it has been played for over 500 years.
 
 The game consists of throwing a small puck, called a *[tejo](glossary://tejo)*, towards a board covered with clay, called a *[bocÃ­n](glossary://bocin)*.
 
 - Note:
 The objective is to hit the *[mechas](glossary://mecha)*, a small exploding pouch filled with gunpowder, located in a metal pipe at the center of the *[bocÃ­n](glossary://bocin)*.

 This AR version of Tejo consists of a tiny *[bocÃ­n](glossary://bocin)* you can place on any detected surface. Wait until *[ARKit](glossary://arkit)* finds a surface, then place it with a tap.
 
 After you place your bocÃ­n, you can throw a *[tejo](glossary://tejo)* by swiping up! The longer the swipe, the further your *[tejo](glossary://tejo)* will go!
 
  - Note:
 Make sure you hit the metal pipe in the middle to score points and light up the fire from the *[mecha](glossary://mecha)*!
